        hi! I'm juan. I'm a front-end developer living in Austin, Texas. 
        Currently working with Vue and Apollo GraphQL at L7 Informatics. On my free time, I'm playing with framework-free design.
        I spend two nights a week teaching at Austin Coding Academy. I'm a Web 101 Instructor. It continues to be an amazing experience. 
        For fun, I enjoy working out and having a beer right after.
